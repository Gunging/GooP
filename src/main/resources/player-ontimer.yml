####    MythicMobs includes the ~onTimer trigger to run skills based off a timer.
####
####    To make players run skills on timer, one must:
####    
####      (A) Make a dummy invisible mob that sudoes the player to run the skill
####    
####      (B) Equip the player with an item that runs the skill on timer
####    
####    
####    Honestly I find this a little inconvenient at times. This file allows to
####    make players natively run MythicMobs skills onTimer
####    
####    Skills:
####      - <SKILL> <TIMER>
####    

#Skills:

  ## Imagine if you were writing...
  ## - skill{s=GOOP_SmokeScreen} @None ~onTimer:5
  #- GOOP_SmokeScreen 5
