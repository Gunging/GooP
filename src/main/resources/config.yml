#   The Stat History of MMOItems tracks all changes to a stat value.
#   GooP commands make it very easy to change stat values, leading to huge
#   NBT stacks as the 'External Data' [EXSH] of the Stat History fills up.
#
#   This is how many entries of NBT before the EXSH consolidates, freeing
#   up memory: +2 +5 -2 +8 -3 => consolidate => +10
#   Essentially, bundles up all information into a single entry.
